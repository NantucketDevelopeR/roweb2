```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "", comment = "")

knitr::knit_hooks$set(
  plot = function(x, options) {
    hugoopts <- options$hugoopts
    paste0(
      "{{<figure src=",
      '"', x, '" ',
      if (!is.null(hugoopts)) {
        glue::glue_collapse(
          glue::glue('{names(hugoopts)}="{hugoopts}"'),
          sep = " "
        )
      },
      ">}}\n"
    )
  }
)
```

Whilst working on the blog guidance, Stefanie Butland and I consolidated knowledge we had already gained, but it was also the opportunity to up our Rmd/Hugo technical game.
In this post I shall go through five things I learnt about Rmd/Hugo.

### knitr hooks

> Hugo has a nice [figure shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure) with options such as width. How do I make R Markdown output such a shortcode from a code chunk, instead of the usual figure syntax?

I asked this question in the friendly French-speaking R Slack workspace[^grrr] and got an answer from both [Romain Lesur](https://github.com/RLesur) and [Christophe Dervieux](https://github.com/cderv): I had to use a _knitr plot hook_!

In the setup chunk[^setup], there should be this code

```r
knitr::knit_hooks$set(
  plot = function(x, options) {
    hugoopts <- options$hugoopts
    paste0(
      "{", "{<figure src=", # the original code is simpler
      # but here I need to escape the shortcode!
      '"', x, '" ',
      if (!is.null(hugoopts)) {
        glue::glue_collapse(
          glue::glue('{names(hugoopts)}="{hugoopts}"'),
          sep = " "
        )
      },
      ">}}\n"
    )
  }
)
```

that reads options from the chunk, and uses options from the `hugoopts` named list if it exists. 

The chunk

````markdown
```{r chunkname, hugoopts=list(alt="alternative text please make it informative", title="title of the image", caption="this is what this image shows, write it here or in the paragraph after the image as you prefer", width=300)} `r ''`
plot(1:10)
```
````

gives `{{` `<figure src="chunkname-1.png" alt="alternative text please make it informative" title="title of the image" caption="this is what this image shows, write it here or in the paragraph after the image as you prefer" width="300">}}` in the Markdown post which is what we wanted.

Now, a bit later, I had a quite similar question...

> Hugo has nice [highlighting options for code fences](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences). How do I make R Markdown show R source code with such options?

This time I knew I was after a _knitr hook_ and used a search engine... I created a _[knitr source hook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/output-hooks.html)_

The code below also needs to be in the setup chunk.

```r
knitr::knit_hooks$set(
  source = function(x, options) {
  hlopts <- options$hlopts
    paste0(
      "```r ",
      if (!is.null(hlopts)) {
      paste0("{",
        glue::glue_collapse(
          glue::glue('{names(hlopts)}={hlopts}'),
          sep = ","
        ), "}"
        )
      },
      "\n", glue::glue_collapse(x, sep = "\n"), "\n```\n"
    )
  }
)
```
